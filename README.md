# MergeKit
A slightly modernised (ARC) framework with Donald Yacktman's MergeKit.

MergeKit is a powerful, well designed and flexible template engine for 
Objective C. It can be used to create code, webpages, documents, etc...

It's the templating engine used by [Mogenerator](https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator).

Includes a PDF with documentation and a few unit tests.
